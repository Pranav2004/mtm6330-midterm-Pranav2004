                        in which the Miura P400 and Countach respectively make a magnificent appearance, the brand’s
                        filmography continues in different movies of various kinds and depths, from “Rocky IV” (1985)
                        in which the main character, played by Sylvester Stallone, drives his marvelous black Jalpa in

                        sparkling grey Aventador, and “Doctor Strange” (2016), behind the wheel of a Huracán.

                        A super sports car soul and the functionality typical for an SUV: this is Lamborghini Urus, the
                        world’s first Super Sport Utility Vehicle. Identifiable as an authentic Lamborghini with its
                        unmistakable DNA, Urus is at the same time a groundbreaking car: the extreme proportions, the
                        pure Lamborghini design and the outstanding performance make it absolutely unique. Urus’
                        distinctive silhouette with a dynamic flying coupé line shows its super sports origins, while
                        its outstanding proportions convey strength, solidity and safety. Urus’ success factors are
                        definitely the design, the driving dynamics and the performance. All these features allowed
                        Lamborghini to launch a Super Sport Utility Vehicle remaining loyal to its DNA.
